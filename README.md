<h1 align="center">Integrated Practice Project: Java Programming ðŸš€</h1>

## Practice 1: Polynomial Manipulation ðŸ“š

The goal of this activity is to enhance Java programming skills by working with classes, methods, constructors, and arrays. The task involves creating a class, **Polinomio**, for polynomial manipulation.

### Features:
- Default and parameterized constructors for polynomial initialization.
- Methods to retrieve information about the polynomial, such as degree and coefficients.
- Operations to set and get specific coefficients.
- String representation of the polynomial.
- Calculation of polynomial value for a given real number.
- Addition and subtraction of polynomials.

## Practice 2: Set of Strings ðŸ§ 

This practice focuses on implementing a class, **ConjuntoDeStrings**, for managing sets of String objects. The challenge involves understanding sets' properties and implementing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

### Features:
- Constructor to initialize the set with distinct elements.
- Methods for cardinality, checking if the set is empty, and adding elements.
- Operations like union, intersection, and difference between sets.
- Equality comparison and checking if one set is contained in another.
- Retrieving elements as an array.

## Practice 3: Electronic Messaging ðŸ“±

This activity dives into object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. The project entails developing an SMS delivery system with contacts, including individuals and groups.

### Key Components:
- **Abstract class Contact:** Generic contact properties and SMS sending method.
- **Class Person:** Represents individual contacts with a name and phone number.
- **Class Group:** Represents a collection of contacts and supports various operations like membership check, addition, removal, and listing contacts.

## Practice 4: College Management (Part 1) ðŸŽ“

This section involves the development of classes for managing an educational institution, including subjects, students, and course enrollment.

### Key Classes:
- **Course:** Represents a subject with methods for retrieving its code and name.
- **Student:** Represents a student with methods for retrieving their identifier, name, enrolled courses, and more.
- **EnrolledStudents:** Manages the set of students enrolled in the educational institution.
- **OfferedCourses:** Manages the set of subjects offered by the educational institution.
- **College:** Main class for creating objects and using the operations of the developed classes.

## Usage and Testing ðŸ§ª

Each practice includes instructions for creating a main program and optional testing classes. Executing the test classes using JUnit ensures the correct implementation of the developed classes.

**Note:** Ensure that the classes are organized in the "tp.practicas" package for proper execution.

Feel free to explore and extend the functionality of these classes to further hone your Java programming skills! ðŸŒŸ
