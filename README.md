## Practice 1: Polynomial Manipulation 📚

The goal of this activity is to enhance Java programming skills by working with classes, methods, constructors, and arrays. The task involves creating a class, **Polinomio**, for polynomial manipulation.

## Practice 2: Set of Strings 🧠

This practice focuses on implementing a class, **ConjuntoDeStrings**, for managing sets of String objects. The challenge involves understanding sets' properties and implementing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

## Practice 3: Electronic Messaging 📱

This activity dives into object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. The project entails developing an SMS delivery system with contacts, including individuals and groups.

## Practice 4: College Management (Part 1) 🎓

This section involves the development of classes for managing an educational institution, including subjects, students, and course enrollment.

## Practice 4: College Management (Part 2) 🎓

This part continues the development of an educational institution management application with a graphical interface. It includes creating students, enrolling them in courses, and updating the user interface based on these actions.
